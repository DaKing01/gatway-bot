0. Bot Create

  Let's finish these

  ![Privileged Intents image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/044463942dc5f9ffb95c76b923ed1b63710ab4503cb89337fd319716549264f2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f443266444d6a452e706e67)

  Please **turn on both settings** for this image.

1. Bot configure

    1. Put your Discord Bot's Super Secret Dynamic Token in `.env`!
      ```env
      token=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN
      ```
      or replit...

    1. Let's change the contents of `config.json`.  
      (The first line that says `memo` is a comment.)
      * domain  
        * The domain used for your verification  
      (Use [https://{Your domain}/verify/{verification id}](#))
      * guild_id
        * The ID of the server that uses this verification bot.
      * role_id
        * An array of role IDs given when verified.
      * use_button
        * Whether to use the MessageComponent (MessageButton) when verificating. If you encounter a problem on Discord such as the button cannot be seen and you want to switch to verification by reaction, set this to `false`.
      * bot_owner_id
        * An array of IDs of people who can place this bot's verification panel. If anyone else sends a panel command, a warning will be displayed in the log.
      * use_japanese
        * If the member uses English, set it to `false`.
    
    1. Get the hCaptcha site key and secret key with [here](https://www.hcaptcha.com).

      Once you have the coolest site key and secret key, put them in your `.env`.
      ```env
      site_key=YOUR_SITE_KEY
      secret_key=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY
      ```

      or replit...
      ![replit_env_sitekey_image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/824067194396737557/862859475638419476/unknown.png)
      ![replit_env_secretkey_image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/824067194396737557/862859717210013706/unknown.png)
  
  Complete! FOOOOOO!   
  Now let's start the bot! Then the bot should be online!
1. Verification Panel
  Run `!verify` on the channel where you want to wake up the verification panel...
  ![panel](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/815719965221978117/862863285455945758/unknown.png)

  (If you don't see the panel, go to the troubleshooting section)

### üî´ troubleshooting
* The panel does not appear when I send `!verify`
  * Calm down and make sure your bot has `VIEW_CHANNEL`,` SEND_MESSAGES`, `EMBED_LINKS`, and` READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permissions on that channel!
  * Check for typos. I often see `!verifi`,`1verify`, `"verify` and so on.
  * Have you changed the bot prefix?
  * Did you mean that you changed the bot prefix, but you changed the `japanese.js` file and it wasn't reflected in `english.js`?
* 'Verify' button is not displayed (panel is displayed)
  * It may be a Discord bug. Set `use_button` in `config.json` to `false`, then run `!verify` again to make it a reaction.
* `Logged in...` is displayed in the Console, but `Logged in as „Äá„Äá!` Is not displayed.
  * Check again to make sure the token is correct.
  * There is a possibility of Discord rate limiting. Try again in an hour.

* At the verification webpage, `hCaptcha has failed to initialize. Please see the developer tools console for more information.`
  * Make sure the hCaptcha site key and secret key are set correctly.
* When I press the 'Vefify' button, the Console says 'Type Error: Cannot read property 'id'  of null' and Bot is thinking forever on Discord.
  * Is both 'Privileged Intents' turned on in the Developer Portal? If it is off, turn it on.
* Verification is complete and the web page says 'Verified!', But no role has been granted and the Console shows `Missing Permissions` or` Missing Access`.
  * Make sure the bot has `MANAGE_ROLES` permissions and the Verified role is below the bot's top role.
  * Make sure the role ID and server ID are correct.
